The following email has been received from Patricia McCartney (nee Hornabrook):-

> About a year ago I was searching the internet for information regarding my family, the Hornabrooks, when I came across the War Memorials page on your site which refers to Richard Kelly Hornabrook and that he is remembered on the Commonwealth War Graves Commission memorial at Louverval. Richard Kelly Hornabrook was my great uncle, my paternal Grandad's big brother. I remember my Grandad talking about his elder brother and that he died in the war. In June, this year, whilst on a visit to Bruges, we drove down to Louverval and visited the memorial and cemetery. Like so many of those that died in WW1, none of his regiment survived and none were actually buried in the cemetery. It was thanks to your site that we were able to make this visit. If you would like any pictures for your site, please let me know.
