We have been reprinting extracts from old newspapers on our Homepage and regularly replacing them with different articles. Many of these articles are funny, interesting or tragic and instead of just deleting them we will in future save them here.

##### From the Royal Cornwall Gazette, Falmouth Packet and General Advertiser of Saturday, November 16, 1872:-

> THE CHARACTERISTIC SPORT of Cornishmen has not deserted those of them who are in America. We learn that a three day's wrestling match has just taken place there, and that Ralph Curtis, of Lelant, Richard Cornish of Gwennap, James Pascoe of Bodminland, Stephen Nicholls, St Agnes, and William Bawden, of Breague, have won the principal prizes. The matches were got up by Messrs Richard Bastian, of Breague, Harry Northehy, Callington and W.H. Davey, Liskeard"

##### From the Royal Cornwall Gazette, Falmouth Packet and General Adertiser of Saturday March 21, 1874:-

> I.O.G.T. ENTERTAINMENT The Pensilva Temperance Choir, led by Mr Kneebone, with some other members of the temperance societies there, visited Venland, St Cleer, on Monday evening last, and interested a crowded audience in the schoolroom for two hours, with melodies, instrumental peices, readings and speeches. All things went 'merry as a marriage bell', except for the conduct of a part of the audience, consisting mostly of young lads, who, as far as manners went, came from Coomassie or the region thereabout. We hope soon to hear of their civilisation."

##### From the Royal Cornwall Gazette, Falmouth Packet and General Advertiser of Thursday July 18, 1867:-

> MINE ROBBERY - At Callington police-court on Tuesday William James, a miner of Bodminland, parish of St Ive was charged with stealing iron from Great Caradon Mine. On finding himself detected, prisoner de-camped, but was captured at St Ive. He was committed for trial at the assizes.

##### From the Royal Cornwall Gazette, Falmouth Packet and General Advertiser of Saturday June 15, 1872:-

REVIVAL OF THE BAND - The celebrated Pensilva Band, which some time ago became disbanded, owing to removals and other causes,
is now resuscitated, the majority being old members. and their former renown is likely to be sustained. They propose during the summer to play at intervals in the national school yard, so that the inhabitants may hear them. This will be on Saturday evenings to be hereafter fixed on.

##### From the Royal Cornwall Gazette, Falmouth Packet and General Advertiser of Saturday March 12th, 1870:-

> MINERS FRIENDLY SOCIETY - This society held its first anniversary on Midsummer Day. The members met at the lodge room, Victoria Inn, and accompanied by the Philanthropic Society, headed by a band of music, marched to the Wesleyan chapel, where sermon of a very appropriate character was preached by the Rev W. Lang, from the Songs of Solomon, 8th chapter, and the former part of the 5th verse. The society appears to be in a very flourishing condition.

##### From the Royal Cornwall Gazette, Falmouth Packet and General Advertiser also of Saturday March 12th, 1870:-

> THE BRASS BAND - We regret to hear that the Pensilva Brass Band is for the present dismembered. This justly renowned band was a credit to the neighbourhood and even to the county and it is a great pity that internal causes should have contributed to this result. People in the district have lost an old friend and a valued one, and we trust that the members will reconsider their decision, and once more charm the public with their music.

##### From the Royal Cornwall Gazette, Falmouth Packet and General Advertiser of Saturday August 7th, 1869.

> BAND OF HOPE FESTIVAL - The Pensilva Band of Hope annual festival took place on Monday. There was a large gathering of children from different societies at the Bible Christian Chapel. About three o'clock they marched, headed by the Pensilva brass band and with scores of banners floating, to the pleasant spot of ground called the old Roman Camp, Tokenbury. Afterwards about 700 visitors and children partook of cake and tea.

##### From the Royal Cornwall Gazette, Falmouth Packet, Cornish Weekly News and General Advertiser of Friday, March 15th, 1878.

> We gather from a recent number of the Black Hills Daily Times, a newspaper published in Deadwood City, Dakota country US; that Mr. Thomas H White, United States Deputy Mineral Surveyor, formerly of Pensilva, Cornwall, has been distinguishing himself in hydraulic mining. Mr. White has, says this authority 'contracted for and constructed two ditches; one for W.A. Beard, three mile long, at a cost of 4000 dollars. Another for L.D. Kellolgg, four miles long, at a cost of 4500 dollars, with a tunnel on the same of 300 feet. The tunnel was holed two days ago and is an excellent piece of engineering. The ditch, two and a half feet deep by three and a half feet wide, is pronounced by the owners to be the best ditch yet built in the Black Hills, and reflects great credit on Mr. White, the engineer and constructor'

##### From the Royal Cornwall Gazette, Falmouth Packet, Cornish Weekly News and General Advertiser of Saturday, October 23rd, 1869.

> STEALING SHRUB AND CIGARS AT BODMINLAND - John Henry Richards 26, carpenter, was indicted for stealing from the Commercial Hotel, Downgate, Bodminland near Liskeard, a decanter of shrub and a box of cigars, the property of the landlord, John Higgins. Mr. Borlase Childs appeared for the prosecution and Mr. G.A. Jenkins for the defence. The prisoner's guilt was clearly proved, but it was attempted to be shown that his intellect was weak, from the result of a fall when ten years old. The statement of Capt. Colvill, however, and the prisoner's career, contradicted the supposition, and the prisoner having been four times previously convicted of felony, was sentenced to seven years penal servitude, with an additional seven years under the surveillance of the police.
