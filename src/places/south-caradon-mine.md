The mine was one of the major copper producing mines in Cornwall with a total output of 217,820 tons of copper ore. It lies in sixth posiition behind Dolcoath (241,522 tons) and Carn Brea Mines (237,500 tons). The sett is bounded by Gonamena Mine to the north, West Rosedown and East Caradon to the north and east and West Caradon to the west.
