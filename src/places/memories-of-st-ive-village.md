The following memories of the village have kindly been provided by Dennis and Doreen Cardew of St Ive.

Dennis Cardew Memories from 1935 to 1950s

When Den was born in 1935 there was possibly only one Bungalow in the village. This was at Keason where a World War 1 Nissen Hut was converted in the 1930s by Mr James Gosney who lived at Trelyn. Trelyn was originally a pub called Tiddly Winks, hence the corner was known by locals as Wink Corner.

SCHOOL: There was a school built 1844/enlarged 1875 and again extended 1929/30. This is situated Liskeard side of Church facing the road. I went there until I was 9, then children went to Callington on the bus. During the war years when the school was full, children would go to the Chapel for their lessons. Some of these were evacuees from London, Plymouth, Bristol.

CORNELLY/RECTORY: House next to Church (Pub side) was the original rectory. Reverend Hobhouse lived there until his marriage when he moved across the road to the new Rectory built for them. In a photo there appears what could be a petrol pump outside Cornelly, have heard this may be so but not confirmed. Also there was a letter box.

PUB: Mr Emerson was the landlord for Plymouth Breweries. Behind the pub was a market, Mr Kivell was the auctioneer, used by the local farming community. Oposite the pub during the 2nd World War there was an American Army Camp.

GARAGE: The Garage was built by Gordon Bawden in the 1950s. Served petrol and did car repairs. Before the garage petrol was available at Quethiock from Mr Harris or Mr Marsh, Pensilva or Mr Daniel, Pensilva.

POST OFFICE: Was situated in house on corner of Blunts turning, run by Mr Davey and daughter Mrs Libby. Post Office had a cigarette machine outside. They would take and send telegrams, I used to deliver them when I was older also to Pensilva. There was also only one telephone, this was at the Post Office. They also sold sweets and tobacco, think also newspapers. There was and still is a Post Box outside, one at Keason (Wink Corner) still there and another near Cornelly (no longer there. Post was delivered by Mr Mitchell who lived in one of the two council houses at Keason. Always understand they were the first two in Cornwall but have no proof of this.

MUTTON'S SHOP: Was next to Post Office towards Callington. It was owned and run by Mr Joe Mutton and Miss Gertie Mutton who supplied groceries.

R.H.LIBBY AND SONS: Heber Libby, Bernard, Les were at the same place as they are now, behind the Post Office on road to Blunts. When I worked for them they were Wheel Wrights, Undertakers, Painter and Decorators.

SMITHY: There were 3 smithies. One at Gang, one at Callington Newbridge and one at St Ive Cross on the corner of the Blunts road, this was run by Mr Richard Hawken father of Mr David Hawken.

CO-OP: The Co-op was at The Cross on the original road from Liskeard to Callington. Manager was Mr Stephens, supplied groceries, household goods, paint, oil for lamps, chicken feed, clothes and possibly other items. I remember going in to buy things with my parents and Mr Stephens would come in after serving oil, wiping his hands on his apron and smoking a cigarette then weighing up bacon. What would health and safety say today! Have heard first Co-op shop in Cornwall not sure if this is correct.

VILLAGE HALL: Was 1st World War Army Hut put up in 1925 by Dad, Grandad and other locals. Rebuilt in 1952 by Mr Leslie Clegg a local man, used to make bird baths, many are still around in village and further afield. Was used for socials, dances, film shows. Dance Band Mr Fred Correll, he was a cobbler who lived at Parkfield. Film Shows run by Mr Hicks from Kelly Bray.

CHURCH/CHAPEL: As they are now. There was a Chapel at Marshgate (on the back road from Dunnderdake to Callington Newbridge). This was said to be the smallest preaching place in Methodism. History of it is very interesting. Dad would keep his car at The Cross Chapel in what is now the Guild Room.

BUS SERVICE - LISKEARD/CALLINGTON: Was Western National and Mr Gillard of Liskeard. Mr Gillard was not allowed to pick up on Western National routes so he picked up on Quethiock Road.
