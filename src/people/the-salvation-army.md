The photographs show the Salvation Army Hut in Lower Middle Hill in Pensilva. As well as the Salvation Army the hut has accommodated the village Scout Troop. Lower Middle Hill is known locally by older residents of the village as 'Army Lane'. The following information was kindly provided by Rob Kinnon-Brettle of the Salvation Army Halls Archive:-
