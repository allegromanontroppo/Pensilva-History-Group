title: George Sidney Strode
---

The Strode family of Newnham Park, Plympton, Devon, were wealthy landowners owning land and property in Devon and Cornwall in the 1800s and early 1900s. In 1851 they owned much of the Middle Hill area of Pensilva and the leases to land and buildings thereon. If you live in a cottage south of the Lower Road in Pensilva it is quite likely that George Strode will appear on the deeds to your property.

In 1919 the Strodes auctioned off their leases to land and property in the area and the various documents connected with this auction are held in Callington Museum. This important document was discovered by a member of our History Group and a copy of all the documentation is held by the Group. This document is important because it actually shows and gives details of the individual properties; who was living in them at the time; and who the leaseholder was if it was a different person to the occupier of the house.

This information is very useful and could assist in tracing who lived in your house before 1919.
