The above photograph has been kindly sent to us by Deborah Hodgson, the daughter of [Marie Bennett](/people/20-mrs-marie-bennett). The photograph shows Daniel and Emmeline Davis and their children outside their farmhouse 'Springfield' believed to be in 1922. 'Springfield' is in Lower Middle Hill in Pensilva.
