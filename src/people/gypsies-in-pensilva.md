The following email has been received form Mrs Marie Bennett in Hertfordshire:-

> My Mum worked in my Aunty Hilda's shop in Princess Street. At that time there was a family of gypsies who lived on Caradon Moor and had done for many years. They were a nice family and caused no trouble at all.

> Well, one of the men used to come into the shop while my Mother was serving and he had on the most raggedy and holey jumper that you ever saw. One day my Mother told him she would bring in a pullover that was his size and in better condition.

> For two days he would come in every five minutes and say, "Hey Missus have you got me pull me over". !!!

> What a character.
